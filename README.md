# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

The goal of the project is to refactorize the churn_notebook to meet industry standards for clean, well-tested and logged code.

## Files and data description

churn_library_solution.py - this python file contains all functions used in churn_notebook_AW

churn_script_logging_and_tests_AW.py - this python file contains test functions for all functions in churn_library_solution. It uses the pytest framework and logs messages to an output file.

churn_notebook_AW.iypnb - refactorized implementation notebook. This notebook should be run to analyse data, train and test models and produce output files (models, performance metrics and visualisations).


## Running Files

% pytest churn_script_logging_and_tests_AW.py
This will test the functions and provide feedback on any errors or problems in the code, as well as produce the results.log file to assess how the script has executed.


churn_notebook_AW.iypnb - run cells within the jupyter notebook to generate analysis, models and output files
